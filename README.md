# UFOs - fact or (science) fiction?

## Purpose of project

The purpose of the project was to build a visually appealing and easy to use HTML based database filter to filter through an array of UFO sightings. This was accomplished using JavaScript to set up filters, and Bootstrap to make the filter appear as filters when opening an HTML file. 

## Results

As can be seen in the image below, the HTML page loads a nice white text against a dark background page, with easy to use filters for date, city, state, country, and shape of object. The user will input something in to each field (use lowercase letters in each field) and the JavaScript filters will perform functions display the results on the page. The image shows the search returning 1 result that is a match to what's specified in each field.

## Summary 

One limitation of this current webpage is it doesn't have a filter for length of sighting. As we can see that's avaialble information, adding a filter for that would be helpful. Another good development would be a table/filter for brightness, in addition to shape. Also, it would be good to have a color table/filter as color is often a part of the sighting comments.
